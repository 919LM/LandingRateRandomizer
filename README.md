# LandingRateRandomizer
A "Landing Rate" calculator with all stats calculated by RNG 

I've been playing a lot of flight sims during lockdown, and the various plugins for X-Plane 11 that allow one to determine the quality of a given landing inspired me to create this code. Note that this does not simulate an accurate flight of an aircraft; it is simply a fun bit of code to see how different Vertical Speeds impact your landing performance.
